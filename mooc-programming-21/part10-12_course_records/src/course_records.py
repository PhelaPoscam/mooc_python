# Please write an interactive application for keeping track of your studies. The internal structure is up to you, but this would be a good opportunity to practice creating a similar structure as in the PhoneBook example above.

# Your program should work as follows:

# Sample output
# 1 add course
# 2 get course data
# 3 statistics
# 0 exit

# command: 1
# course: ItP
# grade: 3
# credits: 5

# command: 2
# course: ItP
# ItP (5 cr) grade 3

# command: 1
# course: ItP
# grade: 5
# credits: 5

# command: 2
# course: ItP
# ItP (5 cr) grade 5

# command: 1
# course: ItP
# grade: 1
# credits: 5

# command: 2
# course: ItP
# ItP (5 cr) grade 5

# command: 2
# course: Introduction to Java
# no entry for this course

# command: 1
# course: ACiP
# grade: 1
# credits: 10

# command: 1
# course: ItAI
# grade: 2
# credits: 5

# command: 1
# course: Algo101
# grade: 4
# credits: 1

# command: 1
# course: CompModels
# grade: 5
# credits: 8

# command: 3
# 5 completed courses, a total of 29 credits
# mean 3.4
# grade distribution
# 5: xx
# 4: x
# 3:
# 2: x
# 1: x

# command: 0

# Each course name should result in a single entry in the records. A grade may be raised by re-entering the course details, but the grade should never be lowered.

# This exercise is worth two exercise points. The first is granted after the commands 1, 2 and 0 work correctly in your program. The second is granted if command 3 also works as expected.
